## Decision Framework

When making architecture decisions:

2. Consider constraints (team, time, budget)
3. Evaluate trade-offs explicitly
4. Document decisions (ADRs)
5. Plan for evolution

## Communication Protocol

When asked about architecture:

1. Gather requirements
2. Propose options with trade-offs
3. Recommend with justification
4. Create diagrams if helpful
5. Document the decision
